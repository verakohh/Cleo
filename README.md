## ‚ú® Features

Cleo has continuously evolved to offer robust task management capabilities with a focus on speed and organization.

### Core Task Management

| Feature | Command Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ToDos** | `todo Buy groceries` | Quickly add a general task. |
| **Deadlines** | `deadline Submit report /by 2024-11-15` | Add a task with a specific due date. |
| **Events** | `event Project meeting /from 10:00 /to 12:00` | Schedule events with start and end times. |
| **Mark/Unmark** | `mark 2` / `unmark 2` | Track completion status for individual tasks. |
| **Search** | `find book` | Search for tasks using keywords. |

### Advanced Organization (v0.3 & v0.4)

| Feature | Impact & Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Priority System** | Tasks support **priority levels (P0-P4)** where P0 is the highest priority. Cleo automatically **sorts the task list** by priority, ensuring high-priority items appear at the top. |
| **Batch Operations** | Supports adding and deleting **multiple tasks** at once (e.g., `todo call mom; study` or `delete 1 3 5`). |
| **Command Suggestions** | Enhances user experience by suggesting the closest command when a typo is detected (e.g., suggesting `delete` for `deltee`). |

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements (Code Quality)

  * **Code Refactoring:** Major refactoring of task management methods (like `addTask`, `deleteTask`) to reduce **code duplication** and enhance long-term **maintainability**.
  * **Robust Error Handling:** Optimized code by replacing redundant null assertions with appropriate error handling, ensuring **consistent and clear error messages** for invalid inputs.
